# ClimbOnüßó

## Overview
This application is intended to allow climbers to track their progress made in the gym. Any gym can create climbs within the app that correlate with climbs in the real world. Upon sending the climb, the climber can log their attempts on the climb, write feedback, and rate the climb for the routesetters. 

## Features
* **Flutter Code Base:** This application is my first attempt at programming in Dart, and is backed by the Flutter code base.
* **Versatility:** The functionality allows any gym to generate QR codes pertaining to their climbs in the gym.
* **Data Collection:** Logs climbers attempts per climb, and optionally allows for climbers to enter height, weight, ape-index, etc.

## Goal
This application is a huge work in progress, and eventually I would like to expand upon it further by increasing the potential for logging each set into the application. Due to most gyms having a set rotation, I would like each climb/set to offer an "expiration date". Climbs that expire would go into the 'History' page and gyms can still view their statistics, but there will be automatic garbage collection on the 'Current Sets' page; this allows for an easier UX design.

## What's Next?
* Login logic
* User & Admin dashboard
* Improve the UI & UX
  
### Admin Side
* Climb details/ qr code print page
* Current sets/ Current climbs in the gym page
* Gym climb history page
* * Data collected page where gym owners can see the statistics from their climbs

### User Side
* 'Climbs' page where users can enter attempts (same as current climbs in the gym page, but from the user's access level)
* User climbing history page: 'Climbed'

## Design Mock Ups
Current mock ups I have designed application's pages.
